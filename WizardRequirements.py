# OVERVIEW
# In this mini-project, you will create a hero character and battle the 
# powerful Evil Wizard. You'll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts 
# to extend starter code, customize your character, and add new functionality. 
# Through a simple menu system, you'll control your character by choosing actions
# like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats.
# Your task is to modify the starter code and defeat the Evil Wizard by implementing 
# your own logic and design.

# ðŸŽ¯ LEARNING OBJECTIVES
# Understand OOP Principles: Practice inheritance, methods, 
# and interactions between objects in Python.
# Build Interactive Programs: Implement a menu system for a turn-based game.
# Design Game Logic: Manage attacks, healing, and enemy 
# interactions to make gameplay dynamic.

# ðŸ’¬ Project Presentation Reminder
# As part of your final deliverables for this module,
#  youâ€™ll also give a short presentation of your project.
#  This can be done live during a weekly Q&A session, 
# recorded and submitted to Google Classroom, or shared directly 
# with your Student Success Manager. If you'd like to schedule a 1-on-1 presentation,
#  click here to book a time.

# ðŸ”§ STARTER CODE
# Start Code is attached at the bottom of this document 
# so make sure to scroll down to get it before you start! 
#  Extend it to complete the project.


# ðŸ“‹ PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
# Create Your Own Character Classes:
#   Add two new character classes in addition to Warrior and Mage. Examples include:
#       x Archer: A ranged attacker with abilities to shoot arrows and evade attacks.
#       x Paladin: A defensive hero who can heal and shield against attacks.
# Implement Special Abilities:
#   Each character must have two unique abilities, such as:
#       Archer: "Quick Shot" (double arrow attack) and "Evade" (evades the next attack ).
#       Paladin: "Holy Strike" (bonus damage) and "Divine Shield" (blocks the next attack).
# Add a Healing Mechanic:
#       x Implement a heal() method that restores health but does not exceed the maximum.
# Randomize Attack Damage:
#       x Modify the attack() method to deal random damage within a range.
# Build a Turn-Based Battle System:
#       Players must choose actions such as attacking, healing, using abilities, or viewing stats.
# Evil Wizard Logic:
#       The evil wizard should regenerate health and attack the player after each turn.
#       Display Victory/Defeat Messages:
# End the game with a victory message for the player or a defeat message if the wizard wins.

# ðŸ“¤ DELIVERABLES
# A Python script containing:
#   x Four character classes (including two new ones).
# Two unique abilities for each character.
# A working turn-based battle system.
# Display victory or defeat messages at the end.

# ðŸš€ BONUS TASKS (Optional):
# Create additional character classes with more complex mechanics.
# Add random elements to the wizardâ€™s attacks or advanced abilities (e.g., summoning minions).
